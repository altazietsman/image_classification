# AI Programming with Python Project

Project code for Udacity's AI Programming with Python Nanodegree program. In this project, we first develop code for an image classifier built with PyTorch, then convert it into a command line application.

This repository includes a Jupyter Notebook that includes the develop code for an image classifier as well as the python scripts used to convert it into the command line. The images used during training, testing and validation is however not included.
